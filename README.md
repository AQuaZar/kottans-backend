## 0 - Git and GitHub

Git is a powerful tool of every developer, it makes life easier and saves time. Git simplifies work with version control, provides easy access to history of changes, it can remove fear of irreparable consequences that allow us to experiment with program, gives us opportunity to collaborate, share projects with other people and a lot more.

Course on Udacity had a great educational impact on me, a big pros that it showed different real situations and how they are handeled with Git. Were studied main concepts like commits, staging area, remote repository, branches and GitHub collaboration principles. Important idea of commiting is to understand not only how make a commit but why and how often.

## 1 - Unix Shell

Command line skills are usefull to operate with file directories, every action performed using GUI can be acomplished by line of code in CLI, this allows us to work faster and be ready to situation when graphical interface don't even exist. Also understanding of CLI is crucial to work with Git. 
Main shell tools that I've learned are:
* directory navigating commands like: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, mv; 
* files operating commands: touch, sort, uniq, grep, sed; 
* output/input redirection commands: cat, >, >>, <, |; 
* and concept that gives us opportunity to code frequently used commands into handy scripts.

The Linux Survival tutorial introduced me a several new commands like:
* 'less' that is used for reading large file contents
* 'lpq' and 'lpqm' used to show and remove printer's queue 
* symbolic link that shows symbolic path of file location and created with 'ln' command
* 'df' command that displays free disk space 
* 'ps' command, used to examine running programs or processes 

An article on [Linux Command](http://linuxcommand.org) provided a couple useful features like Brace Expansion, Command Substitution and now I comprehed the power of `chmod 777` 😄

## 2 - Git Collaboration

This two completed courses, in fact, it's just repetition of earlier covered material with useful additions and some new Git features.
What was learned new: 
* Flags, that used to alter how a program functions and/or what is displayed. For example -p, --stat, --oneline, --decorate, --graph, --all for git log. This flags helps us to get more info about commits and operate with it in more convinient way;
* git show, to access info about particular commit and how it can be reached by HEAD reference;
* git tag, to label commits;
* git commit --amend, useful command to "cancel" most recent commit, allows us to add some files to staging area or change the commit message;
* git reset --soft(resets commit) --mixed(resets commit+index) --hard(resets commit+index+working area);
* git shortlog provides more clear view on commits history;
* Was introduced upstream, that helps us keep up to date our forked repository with original one;
* And at the end was reviewed powerful git rebase, that provides us ability to change past commits, for example rename, squash, delete them and lot more.
